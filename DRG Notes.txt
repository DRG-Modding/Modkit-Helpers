CAS notes:
- /Script/FSDEngine.StaticMeshCarver may need to be set as simple asset?
- /Script/FSDEngine.TerrainMaterialCore JSON is not generated

Audio template assets - either need to use git LFS for cooked sound files or dummy them

=========================================
U37P8 GENERATION
=========================================

Before generating in editor:
1. Use umodel command to extract all psk/psa (skeletal mesh/animation sequence) files
2. Use 3ds max to convert psk/psa to fbx - can semi-automate using batch export script
3. Copy fbx files into JSON output and serialize skeletal meshes so that they get model hash 
4. Serialize all assets except cooked, make sure anim sequences are using UncategorizedSerializer

Order to generate in editor:
1. Textures
2. Materials
3. StaticMeshes
4. Skeletons
5. SkeletalMeshes
6. Run rename/make/delete physics assets python script to match list
7. Regenerate SkeletalMeshes (to fix physics asset references)
8. Cooked assets
9. Sound cues (must be in-editor)
10. Manually import animation sequences
11. Run the JSON for anim sequences to fix notifies - make sure refresh if OFF
12. Select every anim sequence right click -> save (so that fixed notifies persist permanently)
13. Animation Montages
14. Animation Blueprints
15. Everything else
16. Make sure sound classes + sub mixes are connected
17. Copy in correct fonts

Figure out how to serialize SkeletonRig assets -> do they need to be used for skeletal meshes?

Why do certain vanity headwear assets not have skeleton assigned in them? (e.g. /Game/Characters/Vanity2/Headwear/SK_Vanity_Headwear_HelmetCyclops01.json)

JSON that needs to be edited to add skeleton manually:
- /Game/Characters/Vanity2/Headwear/SK_Vanity_Headwear_HelmetCyclops01.json (need to copy and paste skeleton in editor, then set the skeleton in JSON to that)
- /Game/Characters/Vanity2/Headwear/SK_Vanity_Headwear_HelmetDwarfClassic02.json (3P_Dwarf_Rig_Skeleton)
- /Game/Characters/Vanity2/Headwear/SK_Vanity_Headwear_HelmetDwarfClassic03.json (3P_Dwarf_Rig_Skeleton)
- /Game/Characters/Vanity2/Headwear/SK_Vanity_Headwear_HelmetHardhatRadio.json (3P_Dwarf_Rig_Skeleton)

Figure out why /Game/GameElements/Objectives/Escort/DrillDozer/Animations/ANIM_DrillDozer_Doretta_Riding_Idle.fbx/the looking around ones are being generated with 18 tracks even though JSON says it only has 15
Solution to fix: add 3 more bone tracks to JSON (so that it goes up to 18)

Need to populate TrackToSkeletonMapTable in AnimSequences so that the length always matches the max number of "BoneTreeIndex" values in the JSON
Temp solution to fix: add missing tracks in JSON

Figure out why many ABPs with an assigned skeleton crashes editor

Figure out why some float properties within curve vectors are not being serialized correctly

Figure out why some BehaviourTree assets crash on opening but others don't - seems to be tied to whether or not they have a blackboard generated, but sometime not??

U38 GENERATION
=========================================

Things to check:
- "/Enemies/HydraWeed/Assets/ANIM_HydraWeed_Heart_Damaged_Additive" fbx has valid ref pose when generating in editor

- Generate these using umodel psa instead of fmodel due to them being empty/name being too long
    "/WeaponsNTools/Drills/Animations/HeavyDual_Drill_L_OFF.uasset",
    "/WeaponsNTools/Drills/Animations/HeavyDual_Drill_L_ON.uasset",
    "/WeaponsNTools/Drills/Animations/HeavyDual_Drill_R_OFF.uasset",
    "/WeaponsNTools/Drills/Animations/HeavyDual_Drill_R_ON.uasset",
    "/WeaponsNTools/GatlingGun/Animation/ANIM_Weapon_Gatling_Fire",
    "/GameElements/Objectives/Facility/Caretaker/Body/SK_Facility_CareTaker_Body_Anim",
    "/GameElements/Objectives/Facility/DefenseTurret/Assets/ANIM_Force_Field_Turret_Forcefield_Turret_Root_ForceField_Turret_Compressed"

- What is /Script/Engine.Rig? Looks like it could be populated as a simple asset

- "/Script/AnimationSharing.AnimationSharingSetup" is simple asset

- Why are these two anim montages empty?
    FSD/Content/Enemies/Spider/Animation/ANIM_Spider_Spit_Tank
    FSD/Content/Enemies/Spider/Animation/ANIM_Spider_TankBoss_Heavy_Fireball

- Blendspace1D cooked can be duplicate uncooked
- ParticleSystem cooked can be duplicate uncooked - see what happens if you generate JSON over it?

JSON that needs to be edited to add/edit skeleton manually (or copy from previous project):
- /Game/Character/Vanity2/Headwear/SK_Vanity_Headwear_HelmetCyclops01.json (it doesn't use one in-game, so make one for it first)
- /Game/Character/Vanity2/Headwear/SK_Vanity_Headwear_HelmetDwarfClassic02.json (3P_Dwarf_Rig_Skeleton)
- /Game/Character/Vanity2/Headwear/SK_Vanity_Headwear_HelmetDwarfClassic03.json (3P_Dwarf_Rig_Skeleton)
- /Game/Character/Vanity2/Headwear/SK_Vanity_Headwear_HelmetHardhatRadio.json (3P_Dwarf_Rig_Skeleton)
- /Game/WeaponsNTools/GrapplingGun/SK_Pistol_GrapplingGun_01 (SK_Pistol_GrapplingGun_01_Skeleton)

Why exporter not produce fbx for these?
- /Art/Environments/Holiday_GreatEggHunt/Animations/ANIM_GreatEggHunt_WobbleEgg_Wobble_01.uasset
- /Art/Environments/Holiday_GreatEggHunt/Animations/ANIM_GreatEggHunt_WobbleEgg_Wobble_02.uasset
- /Art/Environments/Holiday_GreatEggHunt/Animations/ANIM_GreatEggHunt_WobbleEgg_Wobble_03.uasset
- /Art/Environments/Holiday_GreatEggHunt/Animations/ANIM_GreatEggHunt_WobbleEgg_Wobble_04.uasset
- /Art/Environments/Holiday_GreatEggHunt/Animations/ANIM_GreatEggHunt_WobbleEgg_Wobble_05.uasset

Before generating in editor:
1. Run fmodel mass export script
2. Copy 6 missing animations from previous project
3. Use blender script to mass convert actorX to fbx

2. Textures
3. Materials
4. StaticMeshes

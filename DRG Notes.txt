CAS notes:
- /Script/FSDEngine.StaticMeshCarver may need to be set as simple asset?
- /Script/FSDEngine.TerrainMaterialCore JSON is not generated

Audio template assets - either need to use git LFS for cooked sound files or dummy them

Before generating in editor:
1. Use umodel command to extract all psk/psa (skeletal mesh/animation sequence) files
2. Use 3ds max to convert psk/psa to fbx - can semi-automate using batch export script
3. Copy fbx files into JSON output and serialize skeletal meshes so that they get model hash 
4. Serialize all assets except cooked, make sure anim sequences are using UncategorizedSerializer

Order to generate in editor:
1. Textures
2. Materials
3. StaticMeshes
4. Skeletons
5. SkeletalMeshes
6. Run rename/make/delete physics assets python script to match list
7. Regenerate SkeletalMeshes (to fix physics asset references)
8. Cooked assets
9. Sound cues (must be in-editor)
10. Manually import animation sequences
11. Run the JSON for anim sequences to fix notifies - make sure refresh if OFF
12. Select every anim sequence right click -> save (so that fixed notifies persist permanently)
13. Animation Montages
14. Animation Blueprints
15. Everything else
16. Make sure sound classes + sub mixes are connected
17. Copy in correct fonts

Figure out how to serialize SkeletonRig assets -> do they need to be used for skeletal meshes?

Why do certain vanity headwear assets not have skeleton assigned in them? (e.g. /Game/Characters/Vanity2/Headwear/SK_Vanity_Headwear_HelmetCyclops01.json)

JSON that needs to be edited to add skeleton manually:
- /Game/Characters/Vanity2/Headwear/SK_Vanity_Headwear_HelmetCyclops01.json (need to copy and paste skeleton in editor, then set the skeleton in JSON to that)
- /Game/Characters/Vanity2/Headwear/SK_Vanity_Headwear_HelmetDwarfClassic02.json (3P_Dwarf_Rig_Skeleton)
- /Game/Characters/Vanity2/Headwear/SK_Vanity_Headwear_HelmetDwarfClassic03.json (3P_Dwarf_Rig_Skeleton)
- /Game/Characters/Vanity2/Headwear/SK_Vanity_Headwear_HelmetHardhatRadio.json (3P_Dwarf_Rig_Skeleton)

Figure out why /Game/GameElements/Objectives/Escort/DrillDozer/Animations/ANIM_DrillDozer_Doretta_Riding_Idle.fbx/the looking around ones are being generated with 18 tracks even though JSON says it only has 15
Solution to fix: add 3 more bone tracks to JSON (so that it goes up to 18)

Need to populate TrackToSkeletonMapTable in AnimSequences so that the length always matches the max number of "BoneTreeIndex" values in the JSON
Temp solution to fix: add missing tracks in JSON

Figure out why many ABPs with an assigned skeleton crashes editor

Figure out why some BehaviourTree assets crash on opening but others don't - seems to be tied to whether or not they have a blackboard generated, but sometime not??

- These are all empty anims so make sure their JSONs aren't generated (or just ignore)
    "/WeaponsNTools/Drills/Animations/HeavyDual_Drill_L_OFF.uasset",
    "/WeaponsNTools/Drills/Animations/HeavyDual_Drill_L_ON.uasset",
    "/WeaponsNTools/Drills/Animations/HeavyDual_Drill_R_OFF.uasset",
    "/WeaponsNTools/Drills/Animations/HeavyDual_Drill_R_ON.uasset",
    "/WeaponsNTools/GatlingGun/Animation/ANIM_Weapon_Gatling_Fire",
    "/GameElements/Objectives/Facility/Caretaker/Body/SK_Facility_CareTaker_Body_Anim",

- Name is too long - PSA can only support up to 64 characters, make sure CUE4Parse JSON is not generated before blender
    "/GameElements/Objectives/Facility/DefenseTurret/Assets/ANIM_Force_Field_Turret_Forcefield_Turret_Root_ForceField_Turret_Compressed"

- Figure out why many ABPs with an assigned skeleton crashes editor

- Missing anim:
    Content\GameElements\Objectives\Facility\DefenseTurret\Animations\ANIM_Gun_Turret_Close_Pose.uasset

- "/Script/AnimationSharing.AnimationSharingSetup" is simple asset

- Why are these two anim montages empty?
    FSD/Content/Enemies/Spider/Animation/ANIM_Spider_Spit_Tank
    FSD/Content/Enemies/Spider/Animation/ANIM_Spider_TankBoss_Heavy_Fireball

- ParticleSystem cooked can be duplicate uncooked - see what happens if you generate JSON over it?

- Need to figure out how to serialize custom static meshes, i.e. /Script/FSDEngine.StaticMeshCarver
    /Game/Landscape/Biomes/Biomes_Testing/CleanTester/Assets/SMC_SaltFlake_04

- JSON that needs to be edited to add/edit skeleton manually (or copy from previous project):
    /Game/Character/Vanity2/Headwear/SK_Vanity_Headwear_HelmetCyclops01.json (it doesn't use one in-game, so make one for it first)
    /Game/Character/Vanity2/Headwear/SK_Vanity_Headwear_HelmetDwarfClassic02.json (3P_Dwarf_Rig_Skeleton)
    /Game/Character/Vanity2/Headwear/SK_Vanity_Headwear_HelmetDwarfClassic03.json (3P_Dwarf_Rig_Skeleton)
    /Game/Character/Vanity2/Headwear/SK_Vanity_Headwear_HelmetHardhatRadio.json (3P_Dwarf_Rig_Skeleton)
    /Game/WeaponsNTools/GrapplingGun/SK_Pistol_GrapplingGun_01 (SK_Pistol_GrapplingGun_01_Skeleton)

Before generating in editor:
1. Run cue4 mass export script
2. Use blender script to mass convert actorX to fbx
3. Copy fbx files into JSON output
4. Copy in the fixed single frame anims fbx into JSON output

Order to generate:
1. Cooked assets
2. Textures/Texture2D/TextureCube (can be done in CLI)
3. Materials (can be done in CLI)
4. Sound Cues
5. Everything else not in the rest of this list
6. Static Meshes (might need to do a couple of rounds between editor restarts with refresh off)
7. Skeletons
8. Physics Assets
9. Skeletal Meshes (if it crashes, generate again in debug mode, it may just work)
10. Animation Sequences
11. Animation Montages
12. Animation Blueprints
13. BlendSpaceBase
14. Blueprints
15. Widget Blueprints
16. Simple Assets
17. Make sure sound classes + sub mixes are connected
18. Copy in correct fonts
19. Delete Content\Particles\NC_GlobalParams.uasset

Then:
1. Run check missing files.py and generate missing files if any
2. Copy in the _ folders and the umaps
3. Run a test cook on all folders except Game/Map/SapceRig
4. Run generateDDC bat
